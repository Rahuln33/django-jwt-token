To prepare a README file for your Django project, you'll want to include instructions for installation, usage, and any other relevant details. Here's a step-by-step guide for creating a README file, including the installation and usage instructions for your Django project:

### README.md

# Django JWT Authentication Project

This Django project demonstrates a simple implementation of JWT (JSON Web Token) authentication. It includes login, logout, and token verification functionalities.

## Features
- **Login**: Authenticate users and generate a JWT token.
- **Logout**: End the user session and clear the token.
- **Token Verification**: Protect routes using JWT token validation.

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone git clone https:(https://github.com/Rahuln33/django-jwt-token/)
cd django-jwt-token
```

### 2. Set Up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python -m venv env
source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Make sure you have `requirements.txt` in the project root with the necessary packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If `requirements.txt` is not present, you can install the necessary packages manually:

```bash
pip install django djangorestframework pyjwt
```

### 4. Configure Django Settings

Create a `.env` file in the project root and add your Django secret key:

```
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_key
```

Replace `your_secret_key` with a secure key.

### 5. Apply Database Migrations

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

### 6. Run the Development Server

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

The server will start, and you can access the application at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Endpoints

- **Login**: `POST /login/`  
  Body: `rahul` and `rahul`  
  Response: JWT token if successful

- **Logout**: `GET /logout/`  
  Logs out the user and clears the session.

- **Public**: `GET /public/`  
  Accessible without authentication.

- **Auth**: `GET /auth/`  
  Protected route that requires a valid JWT token.

## Usage

1. **Login**: 
   - Send a POST request to `/login/` with the username and password.
   - On successful authentication, receive a JWT token.

2. **Access Protected Route**:
   - Include the token in the `GET` request to `/auth/` as a query parameter (`?token=your_jwt_token`).

3. **Logout**:
   - Send a GET request to `/logout/` to end the session.

## Project Structure

- `views.py`: Contains view functions for handling requests.
- `urls.py`: Manages URL routing.
- `settings.py`: Django settings including JWT configuration.

## Development

### Additional Notes:

- **Replace placeholders**: Ensure you replace `https://github.com/Rahuln33/django-jwt-token with the actual URL of your GitHub repository.
- **Security**: Always keep your `SECRET_KEY` and other sensitive information secure and do not expose them in public repositories.

Feel free to adjust the README content according to the specifics of your project or additional features you might have.
